**Methodology:** The project involved collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including surveys, attendance records, and leave applications. We used statistical methods and data visualization tools to identify patterns and trends in the data.

**Key Findings:**

- Identified employee working preferences: We conducted a survey to understand employee working preferences and found that a maximum of the employees prefer to work from home. The main reasons cited were reduced commute time, better work-life balance, and improved productivity.
- Reasons for work from home and working from the office: We analyzed attendance records and found that employees who worked from home had better attendance than those who worked from the office. The main reasons for working from the office were team collaboration, access to office equipment, and social interaction.
- Attendance of employees: We analyzed attendance records and found that overall attendance was good, but there were a few employees who had frequent absences. 
- Reasons for leaves: We analyzed leave applications and found that most employees took leaves for personal reasons such as illness, family commitments, and vacations. However, we also found that some employees were taking leaves due to work-related stress and burnout.

**Conclusion:** Our analysis provided valuable insights into employee preferences, attendance, and leave policies. By implementing our recommendations, the company can improve employee satisfaction and productivity.
